Caesar Cipher_decrypt_and_encrypt.py is a simple project I have been working on. Encryption is fascinated and exiting. Learning more about Caesar Cipher and wrote some python script did help me out, and I like the result.

This project is about making a cipher that can encrypt a text or a secret message, and decrypt text or message. I have written a menu for a user to select encryption (1) or decrypt (2) a message. The third option is exiting the script.

I have noticed that there is some minor issue where some words do not get crypted in encryption process. I did not get this issue when I wrote Caesar_Cipher.py and Caesar_cipher_decrypt.py. 

Have fun with my script. Hope you will enjoy it.
